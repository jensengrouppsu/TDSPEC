# TDSPEC - Time Dependent Spectroscopic Simulation Package

## This package allows for simulation of many time dependent spectroscopies including, but not limited to, one photon absorption, two photon absorption, resonance Raman scattering, and doubly resonant sum frequency generation

## To compile, clone the directory. Once in the newly populated directory, run 
'''make'''

This will compile the TDSPEC program to use openMP using gfortran. Other build options can be altered by editing the Makefile before running the make command.
